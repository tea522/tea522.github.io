Non abelian Hodge theory is a very interesting topic. This note is written by Huang pengfei's talk about Higgs bundles. The resulting category of "harmonic bundles'' sits between the categories of Higgs bundles and local systems in a way completely analogous to how harmonic forms mediate between de Rham cohomology classes of closed forms and holomorphic forms. As in the abelian case, the most spectacular applications occur when the base space X is compact KÃ¤hler.
