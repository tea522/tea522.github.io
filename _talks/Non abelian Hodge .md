Please refer to the details on the website [2022 Nankai summer school_Higgs bundles](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn/2022/0627/c11453a460256/page.htm). And another part is from Xukun Zheng, who talks about Non-abelian Hodge theory in our seminar.'

Non abelian Hodge theory is a very interesting topic.  

Related topic: Peter Smillie gave a talk about Higgs bundles and the Labourie conjecture in Tsinghua on September 2nd-September 11st, 2024. Now you can find the recordings. If you are interested in it, please refer to [Higgs bundles and the Labourie conjecture](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1050/3843.htm). 

I hope we can discuss more later.

<!-- The resulting category of "harmonic bundles'' sits between the categories of Higgs bundles and local systems in a way completely analogous to how harmonic forms mediate between de Rham cohomology classes of closed forms and holomorphic forms. As in the abelian case, the most spectacular applications occur when the base space X is compact KÃ¤hler.  -->
